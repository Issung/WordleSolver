# Wordle Solver
Fun 20 minute exercise at a Wordle solver.
Logic is in it's own project and a seperate Console app and Blazor app reference the Logic project.

Might make a Blazor site later hosted via GitHub pages.

Remember strings start from 0 index!

Optional challenge: Make some logic that gives the user the "next best guess" to eliminate the most words.
